## Installation
N/A 

## Usage

When the user selects the red 'Generate Password' button, they will be prompted with a password length. After they selected that they will then choose the criteria they want to include(Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers, or any Special Characters).

Then it will generate a password based on their selections.

If the user does not pick a valid password length, it will give an alert to try again.

If the user does not pick any criteria, it will give an alert to pick one and try again.
